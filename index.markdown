<p class="highlights">Hello! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p class="highlights">I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Ottawa, Canada who enjoys putting things together and make things work. I develop a wide variety of apps from e-commerce platform to multiplayer online games. I also build robots because robots make our life easier, especially if you're a lazy person like me.</p>
