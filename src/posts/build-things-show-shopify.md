In the summer of 2018, Shopify organized "Build Things, Show Shopify", an event bringing developers to develop and showcase their projects. We meet every few weeks at the Ottawa office, spanning the whole summer. Each meetup were different so it was great learning different things.
1. Idea creation
2. App architecture
3. App development 1.0
4. App development 2.0
5. App polish
6. Pre-App showcase (secret event)
7. App showcase (secret event)

I've always had my long-time pet project of mine, Kirim, the cross-border peer-to-peer shipping platform (in other words, smuggling app) that requires further development and mentorship so the event was a great opportunity for me. In the end, I was selected as one of the finalists to present my app to the attendees of the final showcasing event at Shopify.
