When I migrated my website to using Jekyll the other day, I promised myself that that was all I need - Markdown. No more fancy JS nonsense. Even the landing page is rendered with Markdown. Content is king afterall.

Many years later and here I am itching my finger to redesign it after recently dabbling with Next JS, Tailwind and Shadcn UI, which I started using for [RankReel](https://rankreel.app) and really loved its file-based routing and server-side rendering. But it's a blog, a static site, I don't need a server for it, it would be great if it can be exported statically like Jekyll did. Well luckily Next JS has a configuration for that.

So welcome to the new website.
